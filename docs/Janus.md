# **Janus: A Feasibility Study and Implementation Guide for Multi-Point Network Path Correlation Analysis**

## **Section 1: Feasibility, Utility, and Competitive Landscape**

The development of a tool for multi-point packet capture (PCAP) analysis is not only feasible but also addresses a critical and underserved niche in modern network diagnostics. The utility of such a tool, provisionally named Janus, is underscored by the escalating complexity and opacity of contemporary network infrastructures. As network paths become increasingly layered and virtualized, traditional analysis methods often prove insufficient, creating a clear demand for a solution that can correlate traffic flows across these disparate points to provide a unified, evidence-based view of a packet's journey.

### **1.1 The Problem Domain: Opacity in Modern Network Stacks**

Modern application deployments, particularly those built on containers and orchestration platforms, have introduced a level of network abstraction that complicates troubleshooting efforts. A single packet originating from an application can traverse a labyrinth of virtual interfaces, bridges, and software-defined networks before ever reaching a physical wire, making it exceedingly difficult to pinpoint the exact location of packet loss or malformation.1

This challenge is not theoretical; it manifests in common, real-world operational scenarios:

* **Kubernetes Networking:** In a Kubernetes cluster, a simple Pod-to-Pod communication failure can have numerous root causes. The issue could be a misconfigured Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, a host firewall blocking the VxLAN overlay traffic (often on UDP port 8472), an incorrect iptables rule managed by kube-proxy, or even a cloud-provider-specific setting like the AWS source/destination check being improperly enabled for an EC2 instance.1 A tool that can trace a packet from its origin Pod, across the node's virtual bridge, through the overlay tunnel, and to the destination node's networking stack would provide an unambiguous diagnosis where tools like  
   tcpdump on a single node cannot.5  
* **Virtualization Stacks (VMware):** In virtualized environments, network issues can arise within the hypervisor's own networking layer, such as misconfigurations in a vSwitch, problems with Network Address Translation (NAT), or incorrect bridged networking setups.7 An administrator might observe traffic leaving a virtual machine's vNIC but find it never arrives at the physical network gateway. Correlating a capture from within the VM against one from the hypervisor's physical NIC can definitively isolate the fault to the hypervisor's virtual networking components.9  
* **Container Networking (Docker):** Even in simpler Docker environments, networking can be a source of failure. Issues with the default docker0 bridge, incorrect port mappings, or failed inter-container communication on a user-defined network are common.2 A multi-point analysis tool could show that a packet from one container successfully reaches the bridge but is not correctly forwarded to its destination container, or that a packet intended for a mapped port is not being properly translated by the Docker daemon's NAT rules.11

The fundamental value of a tool like Janus lies in its ability to provide irrefutable, evidence-based proof of a packet's transit and transformation, or lack thereof. This capability transforms the nature of inter-team troubleshooting. In many organizations, network-related outages devolve into a cycle of blame, where the application, networking, and virtualization teams each use their own isolated toolsets to prove their domain is not the source of the problem. The networking team presents firewall logs, the virtualization team shows hypervisor performance metrics, and the application team provides a tcpdump from within a container. A multi-point correlation tool bridges these silos. By ingesting captures from all relevant points, it can produce a definitive report stating, for example, "Packet with IP ID 12345 was observed on the container's virtual interface and the host's bridge, but was never seen at the hypervisor's physical NIC. The packet was dropped within the hypervisor stack." This shifts the conversation from qualitative finger-pointing to a quantitative, data-driven diagnosis, drastically reducing both Mean Time To Innocence (MTTI) for uninvolved teams and the overall Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR).

### **1.2 Defining the Niche: Janus vs. The State of the Art**

The proposed tool occupies a unique position in the landscape of network analysis utilities. While many powerful tools exist, none are purpose-built for the specific task of automated, multi-point PCAP correlation with an awareness of modern virtualization constructs.

* **Packet Sniffers (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump):** These are the established standards for deep packet inspection at a single point in the network.12 Wireshark's  
   mergecap utility can combine multiple PCAP files into one, but it does so based on timestamps without providing an engine to intelligently correlate the same flow across the different original capture points.13 It presents the raw, merged data but leaves the complex task of manual correlation to the user.  
* **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA) & Flow-Based Tools:** A significant portion of the commercial and open-source NTA market, including products from SolarWinds and Kentik, operates on flow data (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX) rather than full packet captures.15 Flow data is excellent for high-level analysis, such as identifying top bandwidth consumers or visualizing broad traffic patterns, but it inherently lacks the packet-level detail required to diagnose subtle issues like incorrect TCP flags, payload corruption, or the precise port mappings used in a NAT translation.17  
* **Large-Scale PCAP Indexing Systems (e.g., Arkime):** Tools like Arkime (formerly Moloch) are designed as forensic platforms for storing, indexing, and searching petabyte-scale repositories of PCAP data.19 Their strength lies in powerful search and retrieval, allowing an analyst to find specific sessions from the past. However, their primary function is not the automated, hop-by-hop correlation and difference analysis that forms the core premise of Janus.  
* **Real-time Topology and Flow Visualization (e.g., Skydive):** Skydive is an advanced open-source tool that provides a real-time, graph-based visualization of network topology and active flows.19 It excels at showing what is happening on the network  
   *now*, but it is not designed for the post-mortem analysis of a specific, historical event based on a static set of PCAP files.

The following table provides a comparative analysis to visually position the proposed tool within the existing ecosystem.

**Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Network Analysis Tools**

| Corelight | Security monitoring and network evidence | Live (Zeek logs), PCAP | Alert-driven PCAP retrieval | Yes | Yes | Commercial 21 |

## **Section 2: Foundational Prerequisite: High-Fidelity Data Acquisition**

The analytical power of the proposed tool is fundamentally constrained by the quality of its input. The principle of "Garbage In, Garbage Out" is paramount; a successful analysis is impossible without a rigorous and disciplined data acquisition strategy. This section outlines the critical prerequisites for collecting high-fidelity PCAP files suitable for correlation.

### **2.1 A Strategic Approach to Multi-Point Capture**

To effectively trace a packet's journey, captures must be taken at every significant point of transformation or potential failure along the path. In a typical virtualized environment, this requires a comprehensive capture strategy. A checklist of essential capture points includes:

* Inside the container (on its veth interface)  
* On the host, on the peer interface of the container's veth pair  
* On the Linux bridge (e.g., docker0 or a CNI-managed bridge)  
* On the virtual machine's virtual NIC (e.g., ens192)  
* Within the hypervisor, on the virtual switch port connected to the VM  
* On the hypervisor's physical NIC, before traffic egresses to the physical network.1

While tcpdump is the universal command-line tool for this purpose 1, obtaining visibility into proprietary forwarding planes may require using the built-in packet capture utilities provided by hardware vendors (e.g., Fortinet 22, Palo Alto Networks 23, Juniper 24) or hypervisor platforms (e.g., VMware 25).

### **2.2 The Non-Negotiable Requirement: High-Precision Time Synchronization**

Accurate and synchronized time is the single most critical prerequisite for correlating events across multiple captures. Without a common time reference, chronological ordering of packets from different files is impossible, rendering any analysis of latency or packet loss invalid.26

* **NTP vs. PTP:** While the Network Time Protocol (NTP) is widely deployed, it typically provides accuracy in the millisecond range. On a high-speed network (e.g., 10 Gbps or faster), hundreds or even thousands of packets can be transmitted within a single millisecond. Relying on NTP can lead to incorrect ordering when merging captures from different hosts. For the high-fidelity analysis this tool aims to provide, the **Precision Time Protocol (PTP)**, as defined in IEEE 1588, is strongly recommended. PTP is designed for local area networks and can achieve sub-microsecond synchronization accuracy, which is essential for correctly ordering packets on modern networks.27  
* **Timestamping Methods:** The source of the timestamp is as important as the synchronization protocol. **Hardware timestamping**, where the network interface card (NIC) applies a timestamp as a packet is received, is the most accurate method. **Software timestamping**, applied later by the kernel or the capture library (libpcap), introduces non-deterministic jitter and delay that can corrupt fine-grained latency measurements.29 Furthermore, the PCAP Next Generation (pcapng) file format should be used, as it offers superior support for high-precision timestamps and embedding per-interface metadata compared to the legacy PCAP format.13

The feasibility of this tool is therefore contingent not just on software development, but on a systems engineering prerequisite: the ability to establish a high-precision, common time source across all capture hosts. To measure latency between point A and point B, the calculation Timestamp\_B \- Timestamp\_A is only meaningful if the clocks at A and B are tightly synchronized. Similarly, to declare a packet lost between A and B, one must be certain they are examining the correct time window in the capture from B. A significant clock skew could lead to a false diagnosis of packet loss. This implies that a user of the tool may need to deploy a PTP grandmaster clock and configure all participating hosts as PTP clients. To aid the user, the tool itself should incorporate a "pre-flight check" module. This module would analyze the metadata of the input PCAP files to warn the user if time ranges do not overlap, if timestamp precision is insufficient (e.g., only millisecond resolution is detected), or even attempt to detect clock drift by analyzing a consistent calibration signal (like a continuous ping) that was run during the capture.

### **2.3 Initial Data Aggregation: The Role of mergecap**

Before analysis can begin, the individual PCAP files must be combined into a single, chronologically ordered file. The standard utility for this task is mergecap, which is distributed as part of the Wireshark suite.14 It is crucial to use

mergecap's default chronological merge behavior (mergecap \-w outfile.pcapng file1.pcap file2.pcap), which sorts packets from all input files based on their timestamps. The alternative, concatenation (\-a flag), simply appends the files and would make correlation impossible.13

## **Section 3: The Correlation Engine: Algorithmic Deep Dive**

This section details the formal algorithmic foundation for the tool's core logic. It outlines a robust, multi-layered strategy for uniquely identifying network flows and individual packets as they traverse the network and potentially undergo transformation.

### **3.1 Flow and Packet Identification**

The analysis begins by identifying the two fundamental units of network traffic: flows and packets.

* **Flow Identification:** A network flow, or conversation, is most commonly defined by its 5-tuple: (Source IP, Destination IP, Protocol, Source Port, Destination Port). This tuple serves as a stable identifier for a session. In a Go implementation, this can be represented using gopacket.Flow objects, and a hash of this 5-tuple can be used as a key in maps for efficient state tracking.33  
* **Packet Identification:** The central challenge is that a packet's headers can be modified in transit (e.g., by NAT). Therefore, a reliable matching algorithm cannot depend on any single field. It must use a combination of immutable or predictably changing fields to establish a packet's identity across different capture points.

### **3.2 A Multi-Layered Packet Matching Strategy**

A robust matching engine should employ a cascade of techniques, moving from low-cost, high-probability methods to more computationally expensive but definitive ones. This layered approach increases both the accuracy and performance of the correlation.26

* **Method 1: IP Identification (IP ID) Field:** For non-fragmented IPv4 packets, the 16-bit IP ID field is often implemented as a simple counter by the source operating system. For a given source IP, this field can be a highly reliable identifier for matching packets across short network paths.26 Its primary limitations are that it can wrap around quickly on a busy host, is not guaranteed to be globally unique, and is not used in IPv6 in the same manner.  
* **Method 2: TCP Sequence and Acknowledgement Numbers:** For TCP packets, the combination of the 5-tuple, the 32-bit TCP sequence number, and the segment's payload length provides an extremely strong signature of a specific data segment.26 This method is more robust than relying on the IP ID but is applicable only to TCP traffic.  
* **Method 3: TTL (Time-To-Live) Analysis:** The TTL field in the IP header is decremented by each router that forwards the packet. While not a unique identifier, observing a consistent decrement (e.g., a packet with TTL=64 at point A and TTL=63 at point B) provides strong corroborating evidence that it is the same packet having traversed one routing hop.36  
* **Method 4: Payload Hashing (Post-Reassembly):** The most definitive method for matching packets, resilient to any header modification, is to compute a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the packet's payload (Layer 4 and above). This approach is computationally intensive and, critically, requires that the full TCP data stream be reassembled first. Individual TCP segments can be fragmented and re-segmented as they traverse a path with varying Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) sizes.37 Hashing individual segments is therefore brittle. The correct approach is to reassemble the entire TCP stream at each capture point to produce a contiguous block of application data, and then hash that data. This provides a stable signature for the conversation's content that is immune to network-layer transformations.40

### **3.3 Algorithmic Detection of Network Address Translation (NAT)**

NAT is the process of rewriting IP addresses and/or port numbers, most commonly performed at network boundaries.41 The tool can automatically detect and describe these transformations.

The algorithm for NAT detection is as follows:

1. Ingest two capture files, C\_pre\_nat (taken before a suspected NAT device) and C\_post\_nat (taken after).  
2. Identify a packet P1 in C\_pre\_nat and a packet P2 in C\_post\_nat that belong to the same logical flow. This match must be made using a NAT-resilient technique, such as payload hashing or a combination of IP ID and TCP sequence numbers.  
3. Once P1 and P2 are confirmed to be the same packet at different points in its journey, compare their respective 4-tuples (SrcIP, SrcPort, DstIP, DstPort).  
4. If the tuples differ, a NAT event has occurred. The tool can then report the exact transformation, for example: Source NAT: 192.168.1.10:54321 \-\> 203.0.113.7:18311. This automates the analysis that network engineers often perform manually and validates the best practice of capturing traffic *inside* a NAT boundary to identify the true origin of a connection.41

### **3.4 Quantifying Latency and Loss**

With a foundation of high-precision timestamps and robust packet matching, the tool can quantify key performance metrics.

* **Latency:** For a packet P that is definitively matched at capture point A (as P\_A) and the subsequent point B (as P\_B), the inter-point latency is calculated as Timestamp(P\_B) \- Timestamp(P\_A). The accuracy of this measurement is directly proportional to the accuracy of the clock synchronization between the capture hosts.29  
* **Packet Loss:** Packet loss is identified through inference. If a TCP stream is identified at point A, and a packet with sequence number S is observed at A but is never observed at the next hop B, while subsequent packets from the same stream (e.g., with sequence number S \+ payload\_len) *are* seen at B, it can be inferred that the packet containing sequence number S was lost between points A and B. The tool's report would then flag this packet and indicate its last-known location.

**Table 2: Packet Correlation Techniques**

| Technique | Description | Applicable Protocols | Reliability | Computational Cost | Resilience to NAT/Fragmentation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **IP ID** | Match packets based on the 16-bit Identification field in the IPv4 header. | IPv4 | Medium | Low | Low (Not resilient to NAT) |
| **TCP Seq/Ack** | Match TCP segments based on their sequence/acknowledgment numbers and payload length. | TCP | High | Low | Medium (Resilient to some NAT) |
| **TTL Decrement** | Corroborate a match by observing the expected one-decrement drop in the TTL field. | IP | Low (Corroborative) | Very Low | High (TTL is independent of NAT) |
| **Payload Hash** | Match flows based on a cryptographic hash of the reassembled L4+ payload. | Any | Very High | High | Very High (Fully resilient) |

## **Section 4: A Practical Implementation Blueprint in Go**

This section translates the preceding algorithmic theory into a concrete implementation plan using the Go programming language and the gopacket library, providing a blueprint for development.

### **4.1 The gopacket Ecosystem: Your Core Toolkit**

The gopacket library is the ideal foundation for this project. It is more than a simple C libpcap wrapper; it provides powerful, idiomatic Go abstractions for packet manipulation and analysis.33

* **Reading PCAPs:** The process begins with pcap.OpenOffline, which takes a file path and returns a \*pcap.Handle. This handle can then be passed to gopacket.NewPacketSource to create a channel-based iterator for the packets in the file.42  
* **Decoding Packets:** The gopacket.PacketSource yields gopacket.Packet objects. From each packet, specific protocol layers can be requested, such as packet.Layer(layers.LayerTypeIPv4) or packet.Layer(layers.LayerTypeTCP). This provides typed access to header fields like IP addresses, ports, and sequence numbers, which are essential for the correlation engine.33  
* **TCP Stream Reassembly:** This is the most complex yet critical component of the implementation. The gopacket/tcpassembly and gopacket/reassembly packages provide the necessary tools.45 The core pattern involves creating an  
   Assembler and providing it with a custom StreamFactory. For each new TCP stream detected in the PCAP, the factory's New method is invoked to create a user-defined Stream object. This object's Reassembled method will then be called with the ordered, contiguous data from the TCP stream. This is the point where analysis logic, such as payload hashing, should be executed.34 The official  
   httpassembly and bidirectional examples in the gopacket repository are excellent starting points for understanding this pattern.47

### **4.2 Proposed High-Level Architecture**

A concurrent, stream-oriented architecture is well-suited for this task and leverages Go's strengths. The choice of Go and its concurrency model is a strategic advantage, not merely an implementation detail. The problem of processing multiple large PCAP files is inherently parallelizable up to the correlation stage. Go's goroutines and channels provide a natural and efficient way to structure this parallelism, allowing the tool to effectively utilize multi-core processors and outperform a simple single-threaded script.48

The proposed architecture is as follows:

1. **Ingestion Goroutines:** For each input PCAP file, a dedicated goroutine is spawned. This goroutine is responsible for opening the file, creating a PacketSource, and setting up a tcpassembly.Assembler.  
2. **Stream Reassembly:** The goroutine feeds packets from its source into its local assembler.  
3. **Central Correlation Engine:** The custom Stream objects created by the assembler's factory do not perform the final correlation. Instead, upon reassembling data, they send a structured message (containing the flow key, timestamp, capture point ID, and payload hash) over a channel to a single, central correlation goroutine.  
4. **State Management:** This central correlator maintains the master state of all flows across all capture points, likely in a map\[FlowKey\]\*FlowTrace. When it receives data for a flow, it appends it to that flow's path history, checks for discrepancies (like packet loss), and detects transformations (like NAT).  
5. **Reporting:** Once a flow is determined to be complete (e.g., a FIN or RST is seen across all points, or a timeout is reached), the central correlator finalizes the analysis for that flow and passes the result to a reporting module, which generates the final human-readable output.

### **4.3 Key Data Structures in Go**

The implementation will require several key data structures to manage state effectively.

Go

import (  
    "net"  
    "sync"  
    "time"  
)

// FlowKey uniquely identifies a network flow.  
type FlowKey string // Example format: "tcp:1.1.1.1:1234-\>2.2.2.2:80"

// PacketInfo holds the identifying characteristics of a packet at a specific point.  
type PacketInfo struct {  
    Timestamp   time.Time  
    IPID        uint16  
    TCPSeq      uint32  
    TCPAck      uint32  
    PayloadHash string  
    TTL         uint8  
    SrcIP       net.IP  
    DstIP       net.IP  
    SrcPort     uint16  
    DstPort     uint16  
}

// CapturePointInfo represents a packet's observation at one capture point.  
type CapturePointInfo struct {  
    PointID string // A user-defined name for the capture file, e.g., "veth-container"  
    Packet  PacketInfo  
}

// FlowTrace tracks a single flow across all capture points.  
type FlowTrace struct {  
    PathCapturePointInfo // An ordered slice representing the packet's journey  
    mu   sync.Mutex  
}

// correlationMap is the central state managed by the correlation engine.  
var correlationMap \= make(map\[FlowKey\]\*FlowTrace)

## **Section 5: Project Naming and Positioning**

While a technical consideration, the name of an open-source tool is crucial for its adoption, discoverability, and identity.

### **5.1 Analysis of the Name "Janus"**

The proposed name, "Janus," is metaphorically excellent. Janus is the Roman god of gates, transitions, and duality, often depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions.52 This powerfully evokes the tool's function of "looking" at a packet's state before and after it passes through a network "gate" (like a router or firewall) to see how it has changed.

However, there is a significant issue of name collision. Microsoft has an open-source networking framework named **Project Janus** for Radio Access Network (RAN) telemetry.53 Additionally, the name is used by other software products, including the popular Janus WebRTC Server and the Janus Secure Computing Platform.52 Proceeding with this name would likely cause confusion within the developer community and could present future branding or even trademark challenges. It is strongly recommended that an alternative name be chosen.

### **5.2 A Framework for Naming and Alternative Suggestions**

A good name for a developer tool should be memorable, easy to type, and evocative of its function. A practical step often overlooked in naming is to check for "googleability." Before finalizing a name, one should perform a search for "golang \[toolname\]" or "\[toolname\] network analysis" to ensure the search engine results page is not already crowded, which would hinder the project's discoverability.

Based on themes relevant to the tool's purpose, the following alternatives are suggested 55:

* **Theme 1: Correlation & Stitching** (Emphasizes putting pieces together)  
  * *Suggestions:* PathStitch, FlowWeave, NetCorrelate, PcapStitcher, Synapse  
* **Theme 2: Path & Journey** (Emphasizes tracing the packet's route)  
  * *Suggestions:* NetPathLens, FlowJourney, Pathlight, Nexus, PacketCompass  
* **Theme 3: Visibility & Clarity** (Emphasizes revealing what is hidden)  
  * *Suggestions:* NetSpect (from "inspect"), PathReveal, FlowScope, Clarity, Oculus  
* **Theme 4: Mythological/Literary** (Evokes a powerful metaphor, like Janus)  
  * *Suggestions:* Argus (the all-seeing, hundred-eyed giant), Hermes (the messenger who travels between worlds), Ariadne (who provided the thread to navigate the labyrinth), Charon (the ferryman of transitions).

**Table 4: Alternative Name Candidates and Rationale**

| Name | Theme | Rationale / Metaphor | "Googlability" Score | Potential Conflicts |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Ariadne** | Mythological | Provides the "thread" to follow a packet's path through the network "labyrinth". | High | Low |
| **Pathlight** | Path & Journey | Illuminates the dark, unknown parts of a network path. | High | Low |
| **FlowWeave** | Correlation | Weaves together disparate packet captures into a single, coherent flow story. | High | Low |
| **NetSpect** | Visibility | A portmanteau of "Network" and "Inspect," clearly stating its purpose. | Medium | Could be generic. |
| **Argus** | Mythological | The all-seeing giant who misses nothing, reflecting comprehensive visibility. | Medium | Argus is a common project name. |
| **Nexus** | Path & Journey | Represents the central point of connection and correlation for all network data. | Low | Very common term. |
| **Synapse** | Correlation | Evokes the idea of connecting different points (neurons/capture points) to transmit a signal (packet). | Medium | Common in biology and AI. |

## **Section 6: Conclusion and Strategic Recommendations**

This analysis confirms that the proposed project is both technically feasible and addresses a genuine and growing need in network diagnostics. Its primary value lies in its ability to automate the complex, time-consuming task of correlating traffic across the opaque boundaries of modern virtualized and containerized systems.

### **6.1 Summary of Findings**

* **Feasibility:** The project is technically achievable. The Go language provides an ideal concurrency model for processing multiple large files, and the gopacket library offers the necessary low-level capabilities for PCAP reading, packet decoding, and TCP stream reassembly.33  
* **Utility:** The tool is highly useful. It fills a significant gap in the existing landscape of network analysis tools by providing automated, evidence-based path analysis that is aware of virtualization and NAT, a feature not offered in an integrated way by standard sniffers or flow-based analyzers.1  
* **Challenges:** The most significant challenges are not in the code itself but in the operational prerequisites and algorithmic complexity. Success hinges on (1) the ability to acquire high-fidelity, time-synchronized packet captures and (2) implementing a robust, multi-heuristic correlation engine capable of handling TCP stream reassembly and NAT.

### **6.2 A Phased Implementation Roadmap**

To manage the project's complexity, a phased, iterative development approach is recommended. This strategy breaks the ambitious final goal into a series of achievable milestones.

* **Phase 1: The Two-Point Correlator (Proof of Concept)**  
  * **Goal:** Match packets between exactly two PCAP files.  
  * **Tasks:** Implement basic PCAP reading and decoding. Use the simplest correlation logic (e.g., IP ID matching for IPv4). Ignore TCP reassembly and NAT for this phase. The focus is on validating the core data pipeline and the assumptions about time synchronization.  
* **Phase 2: The Stream-Aware Engine (Enrichment)**  
  * **Goal:** Correlate entire TCP conversations, not just individual packets.  
  * **Tasks:** Integrate the gopacket/tcpassembly package. Implement payload hashing on the reassembled data streams. Add TCP sequence number correlation as a fallback mechanism. This phase makes the tool robust against packet re-segmentation.  
* **Phase 3: The "A-ha\!" Feature (NAT Detection)**  
  * **Goal:** Implement the core value proposition of automatically detecting and describing packet modifications.  
  * **Tasks:** Build the NAT detection algorithm as described in Section 3.3. Refine the tool's output to clearly present the pre-NAT and post-NAT views of a correlated flow.  
* **Phase 4: The Scalable Tool (Productionizing)**  
  * **Goal:** Generalize the tool to handle an arbitrary number of capture points (N-point correlation) and optimize for performance.  
  * **Tasks:** Refactor the data structures and correlation logic from a two-point model to one that accepts a slice of capture points. Profile the code to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks, particularly in the central correlation engine. Develop a clean command-line interface (CLI) and a user-friendly output format.

### **6.3 Final Recommendation**

It is strongly recommended to proceed with the development of this project. A tool that can automate multi-point network path analysis from PCAP files would be a significant and welcome contribution to the open-source network engineering toolkit. By selecting a unique name to avoid confusion and by following a phased implementation plan that prioritizes a solid foundation of data acquisition and stream-based analysis, the project has a high probability of success and will create a powerful and genuinely useful diagnostic utility.
